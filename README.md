<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![Screenshot displaying an overview of the solar system](/public/screenshots/catan-screenshot-1.png)

Welcome to my Settlers of Catan application, inspired by the 2-player version of Catan, Rivals for Catan. This was my first project using TypeScript and itegrating frontend and backend technologies in a single application.

While still in development, the application currently supports key features such as playing and building cards, collecting resources, and initial multiplayer functionality using web sockets with Socket.io.

Future plans for the application include enhancing the multiplayer features, improving the user interface, and adding additional game mechanics. Feel free to explore the project, report issues, or contribute to its ongoing development.
