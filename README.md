<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![Screenshot displaying an overview of the solar system](/public/screenshots/chess-screenshot-1.png)

Welcome to my chess application. As a chess enthusiast, I chose this project as my first major undertaking after learning React. While still in development, the application currently supports all piece movements, castling, en passant, and detects check and checkmate scenarios.
